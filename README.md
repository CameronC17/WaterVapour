Pre-requisite: Ensure Node.js, NPM and MongoDB is installed on your machines. If it's not, google it.

Now, follow these steps:

1. Clone down the files.
2. Navigate to the downloaded repo in the terminal.
3. Run `npm install` in the terminal.
4. Ensure you are running mongod. If not, run `mongod` in the terminal.
5. Populate the database with some of our test data if you want to. Run `node mongoFill.js` to add data to the database.
6. Then, run `node app.js` to start the server.
7. Have fun!
